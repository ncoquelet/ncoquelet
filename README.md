## About Me

- Senior Software Engineer
  - primarily with ruby, but also other langs
- ~15 years experience
- located in Tokyo, Japan
- focus on team process, testing and maintainability

### Not just an engineer

- **Collaborator:** I prioritize solving the right problem for the client. Through collaboration, with product, design and other stakeholders we often discover that the obvious solution is not the best and even the problem itself may not be what we thought.
- **Process-Oriented:** I have a strong focus on process and believe in fine-tuning it for the team. While Agile methodologies provide a foundation, I advocate for tailoring processes to fit each team's unique needs.
- **Mentorship:** I've had the privilege of helping numerous engineers skill-up, both within the codebase and in their collaborative processes.
- **Advocate for Automated Testing:** I firmly believe in the power of automated testing. Well-written tests not only improve build & release confidence they also double as documentation of code and the original intent behind it for years to come.

#### Kompliant

- Spearheaded the development and launch of a broad Fin-tech application, as **lead developer** from inception to initial customer releases.
- Utilized a tech stack of Ruby on Rails and Hotwire.
- Proactively educated the team on best practices for Turbo and Stimulus, elevating the skill set and productivity of fellow developers.
- Oversaw and implemented numerous asynchronous API integrations for deeper KYC.
- Prioritized robust security measures and stringent customer-data protection while balancing the need for longer-term maintainability and speed of release.
- Ensured zero downtime releases.
- Taught training sessions and helped level-up new engineers as they joined.

### Previous roles

#### 🌟 Founder, CTO & Engineer at TLC List Inc. (2020-2022) (side-startup)
